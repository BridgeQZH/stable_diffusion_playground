## Generate images using stable diffusion
    
## Setup

Follow the next steps to run this code:

1. `git clone https://github.com/gordicaleksa/stable_diffusion_playground`
2. Open Anaconda console and navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo`
3. Run `conda env create` from project directory (this will create a brand new conda environment).
4. Run `activate sd_playground` (for running scripts from your console or setup the interpreter in your IDE)
5. Run `huggingface-cli login` before the first time you try to use it to access model weights.

That's it! It should work out-of-the-box executing environment.yml file which deals with dependencies. <br/>
